The tidal io module includes two functions to import data: `request_noaa_data` which pulls data from the website, and `read_noaa_json` which loads a JSON file.  The request function can save the JSON file for later use.  \n",

This data contains 1 year of 6 minute averaged data from the Southampton Shoal Channel LB 6 (Station Number: s08010) in San Francisco Bay. The data includes 6 minute averaged direction [degrees] and speed [cm/s] indexed by time. The DataFrame key names returned by NOAA are 'd' for direction and 's' for speed. Since MHKIT uses SI units, speed is converted to m/s. "
